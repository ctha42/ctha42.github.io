    <h1>What Does it Mean to Be Well Educated?</h1>
    <p>To be well educated is to understand our insignificance and ignorance. To have the ability to understand that morals are a construct built out of nothing, that true knowledge is an impossibility and most of all accepting that ultimately, life is meaningless and that at the end of the day, none of this matters.</p>
    <p>Throughout different cultures, morals and ideals greatly differ. It is important to understand that there are no “correct” or “incorrect” morals. Being able to understand this is essential to understanding the world. One culture's brutality, immaturity, or lack of civility can be civil, mature, and the norm in another culture. At the end of the day, we are simply a sum of those that came before us. In Alfie Kohn’s essay “What Does It Mean to Be Well-Educated?” He states: “Is such a definition [of being well educated] expected to remain invariant across cultures?” In other words, should education (or anything for that matter) be absolute? Shall it not be built off of culture as is everything else in society? Kohn explores this: “It is misleading and even dangerous to justify our own pedagogical values by pretending they are grounded in some objective, transcendent Truth [sic], as though the quality of being well-educated is a Platonic form waiting to be discovered.” He understands that education, like everything, is not objective and is instead based on subjectivity and personal morality.</p>
    <p>Kohn expands on this idea of objectivity further: “To cast a skeptical eye on such claims is not necessarily to suggest that the term [to be well educated] is purely relative”. This quote explores the philosophy that ideas can be objectively true, regardless of morals or cultural and societal ideals. This is incorrect. The idea of philosophical skepticism explores the thought that true knowledge is impossible. While it's simple enough to accept that knowing anything wholly is impossible, if our hypotheses have gotten us this far, is there a difference? For example, gravity is just a theory. A theory with overwhelming evidence, but a theory nonetheless. If humanity was completely wrong about gravity and it didn’t exist, does it matter? The theory of gravity got us to the moon, allows planes to fly, and allows us to create skyscrapers, all without leaving much up to skepticism and interpretation. True knowledge is impossible, but knowledge that seems correct and works for us is good enough, right?</p>
    <p>It is common to hear that we are a blip in the wide expanse of the universe. Not your life, not your bloodline, but humanity itself. On a scale of infinity, we’re not even something as significant as that. We are an infinitely insignificant accident and nothing more. Even if you become Elon Musk, Bill Gates, or George Washington, on a scale of infinity, you and everything you’ve ever known never even existed. This idea is harsh and hard to accept, but time goes on forever and we are not, so it is impossible for us to even begin to rationalize our insignificance. Simply put, life has no meaning. We are here. We weren’t before, and soon, we won’t be anymore. We simply just are. In the essay “The Myth of Sisyphus'', Albert Camus explores the idea of a meaningless journey through the lens of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to an infinite cycle of pushing a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down again, repeating the cycle for eternity. He uses Sisyphus's punishment as a metaphor for the human experience of striving for meaning and purpose in a world that ultimately lacks both. It argues that, at the end of the day, you must give your life purpose, and that the struggle of life itself is what gives it meaning.</p>
    <p>Being well-educated is being able to understand and accept these truths. Being able to say “I’m here for no reason” without fear is essential to understanding the idea of our existence. The fact that life is something we are forced to live in, so we may as well enjoy the ride. Albert Camus summed this up well: “Life is meaningless, but worth living, provided you recognize it’s meaningless”. As stated before, answering any question fully is impossible including your purpose or why you’re here. Finding out what makes you smile, laugh, cry or just feel alive is what makes life meaningful. Being well educated is to understand that you’re simply along for a very strange ride, accepting that, and ultimately, being able to find meaning in all of it anyway.</p>
