    <h1>What are the limits of government intervention in the digital era?</h1>
    <p>Chapter I: Introduction<br>
    Is Big Brother always watching? This is a question I have found myself asking over the
    last year or so. The digital age has brought immense amounts of positivity to the world,
    but it has also introduced a new era of surveillance into the everyday lives of millions of
    people. Every day, without knowing it, You serve your data up to corporations on a silver
    platter. Seemingly innocent things such as using social media apps, shopping online, and
    even opening certain software all contribute to the mass surveillance being done online. Even
    the simple act of browsing is no longer safe from prying eyes.
    Corporations sell your data from right under your nose to the highest bidder, and as society becomes more dependent on the internet, this problem will only worsen. Corporations
    aren’t the only ones to blame either, governments around the world have also been exposed
    numerous times for spying even more invasively through programs like PRISM and TEM-
    PORA. This paper is an effort to explain why you should care about online surveillance,
    how it happens, and why you should fight back and maintain your right to privacy.

    <p>Chapter II: Why privacy matters<br>
    It is no secret that privacy is at the center of democracy, I think that Edward Snowden
    put it best when he said “Under observation, we act less free, which means we effectively
    are less free.” An opinion shared by many people I discuss this topic with is “I don’t have
    anything to hide, so why should I care about privacy?” or  “The only people that need to care
    about privacy are criminals”. I have a very simple answer for this, you do care about your
    right to privacy, just maybe not in this context. I propose a very simple question, being, ”if
    you have nothing to hide, then why do you close the door when you go to the bathroom?” or
    ”If you have nothing to hide then why don’t you give me the passwords to your accounts?”
    or ”If you have nothing to hide, why do you have a passcode on your phone?”. The fact
    of the matter is that everyone has something to hide, or at the very least, something they
    would rather not share with everyone. I think this is a common issue because most people
    don’t truly understand the internet yet.
    The internet has only been common in the average American household for about 25
    years, and with this new technology, comes new things to understand. Most people use
    Google every day, and they don’t bat an eye. Searching for this and that, while not un-
    derstanding that every search they make actually goes somewhere to be processed. Privacy
    matters for quite a simple reason: Knowledge is power. Your information is, and always
    had been, well, yours, and just because you chose to share this information, does not mean
    that it was to be shared with everyone. Imagine if you told a secret to a friend and they
    told everyone in your social circle. You then angrily ask them ”Why did you do that?!?”
    and they simply respond by saying ”Well, you told me, so why can’t everyone know?” This
    happens all the time in Silicon Valley, ever made a Google search and seen ads for products
    revolving around it? This is because any ’PII’, or ’Personally identifiable information’ you
    provide to online services is worth gold to companies, usually to serve you relevant ads or
    sold to ”data brokers” for a massive profit.</p>

        
    <p>Chapter III: How it all works<br>
    I’m going to try to keep this section short, so as to not bore you with the technical details
    over all of this, but the concept is simple. There are a couple of ways of keeping track of who
    is who online, the most common for most people is simple, accounts. You log in, and just like
    that, there you are, you can now easily differentiate one user from another. Bob searches for
    Computers, Hi-Fi audio, and expensive clothes. Alice searches for gardening, photo editing
    and graphic design. This information can then be recorded and used to help serve you more
    relevant advertisements, which increases the chance you click, and earn Google a couple more
    Cents. A few more ways to go about doing this are a little more nefarious. When you use
    the internet, you have what are called cookies, these are small text files that websites can
    save in your web browser, to remember logins, settings, game saves, etc. It is important to
    remember that these cookies can contain whatever the website wants them to contain. So,
    if you, for example, wanted to keep track of what someone searched for, you can contain
    that in a cookie. Cookies are also shareable between sites, these so-called third party cookies
    allow companies like Google to keep track of you between sites. Both of these factors and a few others greatly contribute to methods of tracking online.
    There are a few other methods of tracking online, but those are really out of scope for
    this paper.</p>

    <p>Chapter IV: Should the Government Prosecute Journalists Who Publish Classified Information?<br>
    In 2013, It was impossible to ignore the name Edward Snowden, A whistleblower who
    published large amounts of classified government material from the NSA while working as a
    subcontractor. He revealed immense amounts of data, suggesting that the NSA, along with
    the Five Eyes, An intelligence alliance consisting of The United States, Canada, Australia,
    The United Kingdom, and New Zealand, were developing and operating numerous uncon-
    stitutional surveillance programs, spying on the public. When the news came out, there was
    a division among the public. Some hailed Snowden as a hero, while others branded him a
    traitor, and went as far as to say that he should be tried for treason.
    I believe that not all confidential information is treated equally. Snowden was doing his
    job when he came across this information, not snooping around. The information presented
    itself, and I believe he did the right thing. The details of the leaked information are alarm-
    ing, Showing programs like the NSA’s PRISM which collected information from American
    internet service providers (ISPs), and other private, internet-oriented companies, such as
    Google. The United States was not the only one doing this either, The United Kingdom had
    a similar program known as TEMPORA, which allowed for gathering internet information
    en route so that it could then be analyzed at a later time.</p>

    <p>Chapter V: Does WikiLeaks Serve the Public Good?<br>
    WikiLeaks is an organization that published leaked documents and information, mostly
    from whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden. The organization operates in a legal grey
    area, leaking information that they did not obtain illegally, but may have been illegally
    obtained by others. Sure, the legal questions are controversial, but the moral questions are
    even more so. The question of if WikiLeaks serves the public good is a very complicated one. Sure,
    it has helped to reveal alarming information from governments, but it also breached the
    privacy of plenty of innocent people. The site has revealed Social Security numbers, medical
    information, credit card numbers, and details of suicide attempts throughout its history,
    which has done nothing but violate the privacy of innocent civilians, usually having nothing
    to do with the wrongdoing being published. The information is truly accessible to anyone,
    just launch your web browser and search for the website, and lo and behold, all the leaked
    information is right there available to download. WikiLeaks is still around publishing leaked
    data for the world to learn from, the moral question of whether what they’re doing is okay,
    still unanswered. </p>

    <p>Chapter VI: Should Intelligence Agencies Wiretap the Internet?<br>
    The United States Government has been vocal in its support to implement mass surveil-
    lance (duh), and when they aren’t doing it illegally, They are trying to pass legislation to
    make it legal. When asked why this is something that needs to happen, the answers are
    always the same. Either for the protection of children or counter-terrorism. We all can agree
    that both are things nobody wants to exist, but frankly, this won’t do anything to help the
    problem. The people that do these kinds of things online are typically educated, much more
    educated than the average person in what to do to stay hidden and avoid getting caught.
    All that does is leave you with everyone else like you and me. Illegal things online have and
    always will be a cat and mouse game between governments and offenders and we’re the ones
    stuck in between it all.The government has the resources to get so-called backdoors implemented into Google,
    Apple, and Microsoft enabled devices. Once that happens the people that truly have some-
    thing to hide from the government will simply change the software and hardware they use,
    leaving everyone else behind, and as this cat and mouse game continues, so will overreaches
    of government in the tech space. Quite simply put, this won’t help to solve the problem. </p>

    <p>Chapter VII: Should the Government Mandate Net Neutrality?<br>
    Net neutrality is the principle that internet providers will treat all communications
    equally, In other words, one site is equal to another. Without this, internet service providers
    could slow your internet connection for certain sites, and even charge extra for access to
    certain sites. This is something nobody wants, but during Donald Trumps’ administration,
    they had a different idea, being, to let capitalism run its course. Essentially, the things net
    neutrality protects won’t need to be protected because competition by itself will weed out
    the bad deals, and throttled connections. There are numerous reasons that this is a horrible
    idea, the main being that internet providers are almost always already monopolistic in certain areas. For example, In Carson City, Spectrum is typically your only option if you want
    modern speeds. If Spectrum would then engage in any of the frowned upon practices, there would be nobody else to go to.
    The government needs to put its foot down in the realm of net neutrality, as it protects
    the freedom of Americans from monopolistic corporations. Luckily, none of these bills ever
    passed and the internet is still free to live on how it always was, a free place to express
    yourself however you like, without the intervention of corporations or governments, though
    We never know when that could change. </p>

    <p>Chapter VIII: Conclusion<br>
    The internet age is here and it is not going away anytime soon, and as I stated before,
    Knowledge is power. I hope I have helped you to better understand the rapidly changing
    landscape of the internet, along with why you should care, how it works, how the government,
    along with private corporations track you on the internet, and why you shouldn’t stand
    for this and maintain your right to privacy in this wild west of an exiting, new, but also
    frightening world. To end this all, I want to once again ask you the question I started this
    paper with, Is Big Brother always watching? </p>
